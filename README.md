# Manavya – Unified Support Platform for Orphanages & Old Age Homes

Welcome to **Manavya**, a compassionate digital platform that bridges the gap between generous individuals and those in need — specifically orphaned children and the elderly in care homes.

## Problem Statement

Many orphaned children and elderly individuals in care homes suffer not due to a lack of goodwill, but due to the absence of a structured way to receive timely help. Often, their basic needs like medicines, clothing, or companionship go unmet because society doesn’t know how or where to contribute. Meanwhile, those willing to help lack clarity or trust in the process.  
**Manavya** aims to restore that human connection by creating a transparent, compassionate platform where care is organized, donations are meaningful, and dignity is restored to every life it touches.
